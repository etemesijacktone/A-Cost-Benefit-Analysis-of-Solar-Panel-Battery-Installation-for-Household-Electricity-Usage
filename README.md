# Solar Panel Battery Installation Cost-Benefit Analysis

## Background

Households have electricity usage needs that can be met by either purchasing electricity from a provider or generating it using solar panels. This project involves a cost-benefit analysis of installing a solar panel battery to store excess electricity generated by solar panels.

Naomi has already installed solar panels on her house's roof to generate electricity. She aims to save costs by reducing her reliance on purchased electricity. Currently, the electricity generated from her solar panels is utilized in real-time. However, she's considering purchasing a battery to store surplus solar energy for later use when solar generation is insufficient.

The battery Naomi is considering costs $7,000 and has a projected lifetime of 20 years. It can store up to 12.5 kWh of electricity at a time. Any excess electricity generated when the battery is full cannot be stored. Electricity consumption is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh).

From January 1, 2022, Naomi will pay $0.17 per kWh of purchased electricity, with prices increasing annually due to inflation. The expected annual electricity price inflation is 4%, but Naomi believes it could rise by an additional 0.25% annually due to climate change concerns.

Naomi has provided data for her solar electricity generation and usage for 2020 in hourly increments, except for February 29. She wants to analyze potential savings in electricity costs by installing the battery. She aims to calculate the extra electricity capacity and cost savings from combining solar panels and batteries compared to using only solar panels.

## Objectives

This project aims to:
- Calculate the additional electricity (in kWh) that can be met through the solar panel and battery combination compared to using only solar panels.
- Determine the implied dollar ($) savings in electricity costs resulting from the battery installation.
- Calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for two scenarios:
  - Scenario 1: Electricity prices increase by the expected government rate of 4% per year.
  - Scenario 2: Electricity prices start at 4% annual increase and rise by an additional 0.25% per year.

## Files Included

- **Data**: Hourly solar electricity generation and usage data for 2020 (excluding February 29).
- **Analysis Documentation**: Detailed documentation of the cost-benefit analysis process.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: A notebook containing the code used for data analysis and calculations.
